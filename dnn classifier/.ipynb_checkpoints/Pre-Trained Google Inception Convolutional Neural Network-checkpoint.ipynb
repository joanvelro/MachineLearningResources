    "Machine learning, in particular, deep learning is awesome in what it can accomplish. It is also computationally taxing and training a convolutional neural network on 10,000 images could take months on a laptop. Luckily, Google has not only developed their own Python library for deep learning, Tensorflow, and shared it with everyone, but they have also shared their own networks that have already been trained on substantial datasets. What that means to us is that we can use our own pictures and Google's pretrained models to classifiy some images and then later trained only the last layer of the pre-trained model if we want to train on our own labeled data.
